- `app/assets/javascripts/incremental_app/` contains files that build on the previous one.
- `spec/javascripts/incremental_specs/` contains Jasmine specs for each of those files.

Note that some of these examples are rather contrived; instead of being good examples of TDD, these were thrown together quickly as examples of how to accomplish specific goals with Jasmine.
